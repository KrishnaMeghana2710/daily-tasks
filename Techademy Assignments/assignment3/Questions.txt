Write also a parameter constructor to initialize length and breadth with any given values.
Write the main program to test the functionality of Rectangle class. 
Use the "this" keyword wherever it is required.


2. Create a Rectangle class with length and breadth properties. 
Include a parameter constructor to initialize these properties.
Write a static method "flipRectangle" which takes a Rectangle object 
and return a new rectangle with the length is same as breadth of the 
first rectangle and breadth is same aslength of the first rectangle. 
Include the display method to display the dimensions of rectangle.


2) Create an abstract class with the name "Shape" to represent 2D geometric shapes. 
It should have 2 properties dim1, dim2.include an abstract method "calculateArea()".
Provide 3 sub classes with the names "Rectangle", 
"Circle" and "Triangle", each of these should provide implementation for
